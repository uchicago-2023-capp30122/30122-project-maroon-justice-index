Period poverty is defined as “limited or inadequate access to menstrual products or menstrual health education as a result of financial constraints or negative socio-cultural stigmas associated with menstruation.” Period poverty can be harmful to one’s health, such as using products longer than recommended, and emotional well-being, such as missing work or school due to period leaks, pain and shame. Period poverty is disproportionately affecting those who are impoverished or experiencing homelessness. 
 
We wanted to understand this disparity geographically in Cook County, IL. We focused on factors such as income, public assistance usage, number of menstruating people, percent of income spent on rent, and proximity to community-based services. Using these variables, we created an index at the census tract level and visualized it on a map. We found that the risk of period poverty was concentrated in three areas – west side, south side and far south side. We also found that the number of community centers was correlated with our index- areas with less access to community-based services were, on average, at higher risk of period poverty. From this analysis, we were able to identify neighborhoods that would benefit the most from greater access to free menstrual care resources.
